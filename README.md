# OpentronsOT2_Protocols
Protocols for the Opentrons OT-2 Pipetting Robot

*Note: These protocols take inputs and are designed to be run through the Command Prompt. 

## What is in this repository?

functions_v2.py is a basic testing protocol. A good jumping off point containing a few basic operations I use frequently. 

mm_setup.py and cDNA_synthesis.py are complex protocols used in parts of a Q-RT-PCR pipeline.

mm_setup_printout.pptx and cDNA_synthesis_printout.pptx are powerpoint presentations to help visualize the deck state. We keep these on the desk next to the OT-2 so we can see what we physically need to put in place before we begin actually running a protocol.
